# AtreyaRao_Frontend_Backend

Backend:
The backend has 2 routes 
1)/routes/api/getBounce: It will take in 2 form data (height,coefficient of restitution) and return:height[],time[],Bounces.
                          After this it will store the result in a localData.json file.
2)/routes/api/getPrev: It will retrive value stored in localData.json file.

Note: I got these formulas from different website it may not be perfect and minor errors can occur.


Front End:(React)

The main logic of the front end is written in App.js.
I am using a 3rd party library for graph: Canvas.js

I have also used angular as front end (only front end project ) Images in the google form.
